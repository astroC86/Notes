Let A,B,C be finite sets. Prove that $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$. What about $|A \cup B \cup C|$? Find a formula in terms of set intersections, i.e., in terms of $|A|, |B|, |C|, |A \cap B|, |A \cap C|, |B \cap C|, |A \cap B \cap C|$. Prove that your formula is correct!

There is a general formula for determining the size of a union $A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n$​ in terms of intersections of those. This is called the _inclusion-exclusion_ formula:

$$|A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n| = \sum_{\emptyset \ne I \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|I|+1} \left| \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \right|$$

In words, the size of the union is (1) the sum of the set sizes; minus (2) the sizes of all pairwise intersections; plus (3) the sizes of all three-wise intersections, and so on. Prove the inclusion-exclusion formula.
