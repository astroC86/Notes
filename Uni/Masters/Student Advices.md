  
Honestly I wouldn't recommend my strategy to anyone:
-   Do projects only on weekends.
-   Usually dedicate one full day to complete the project from start to finish
-   Mids and Finals are always across a weekend.
-   Use Saturday to prep, includes watching lectures
-   Give the exam on the Sunday
-   Relax on weekends on which nothing is due.
