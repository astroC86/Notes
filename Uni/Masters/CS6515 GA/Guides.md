**Student Advice:**
-   Visit the course page now to review the prerequisite knowledge.
-   Ensure you have covered the required concepts before the semester begins.
-   Students are expected to be familiar with:
    -   Big O runtimes
    -   Dijkstra's algorithm
    -   Basic graph terminology
-   While some students take the course without this background, it makes the course significantly more challenging.
-   Fluency in these concepts is expected.
-   If you struggled with these topics as an undergraduate or havenâ€™t encountered them in a while, review them before the semester starts.
